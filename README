This source tree contains the Qt Quick Components project.

Building
========
configure -symbian
make
make install

The project is divided into:

- The module Qt.labs.components: _for now_ contains general purpose helpers for QML.

and also (for the time being) two QML modules for component sets implemented using those components

- com.nokia.symbian: set of UI components for Symbian.

The lib will install in QTDIR/lib, while the modules will go to QTDIR/imports.

Build dependencies
==================
- Qt 4.7.4
- Symbian components set currently requires Qt 4.7.4

Coding Style
==================
Follow the respective Qt coding style for C++ and QML files and the
JavaScript coding style for JS only files.

Coding Styles
- Qt C++: http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/pages/QtCodingStyle
- QML: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-coding-conventions.html
- JS: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/Coding_Style


Building the Documentation
==================

To generate the Symbian components documentation:
configure -symbian
make docs

This will generate HTML files in the doc/html directory. Also, a qch file will
be generated in the doc/qch directory. This qch file can be loaded in
Qt Assistant or Qt Creator.
