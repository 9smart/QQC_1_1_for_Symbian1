Installing Qt Components help
=============================
The qtcomponents.qch is a Qt Help file containing documentation for the Qt
Components. You can install it in Qt Creator to get F1 help for Qt Components.

1. Copy the qtcomponents.qch to the documentation folder for your Qt
installation. For example, in the Qt SDK on Windows, this folder is
C:\QtSDK\Documentation.

2. Open Qt Creator and, from the main menu, select "Tools" -> "Options..."

3. Select the "Help" settings, and the "Documentation" tab

4. Click the "Add..." button then navigate to and open the qtcomponents.qch file.

5. You should now have a "com.nokia.qtcomponents" in the list of registered
documentation.

6. Click OK to close the Options dialog.


Using the help
==============
Once you have installed the Qt Components help, you will be able to access the
content from the help reader in Qt Creator. F1 Help is also enabled, so, in your
code, you can move the cursor to a Qt Component name and press F1 to see the
class reference for that component.


Updating the help
=================
The help documentation is being continuously updated. When you get a new
qtcomponents.qch file, you can just copy it over the old file.
