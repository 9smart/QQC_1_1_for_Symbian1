    \brief Provides a functionality for scrolling a long list by one section at
    a time.

    A section scroller is a component that allows the user to scroll through
    a list by one section at a time.  The sections are defined in the list.

    \code
    Item {
        anchors.fill: parent

        ListModel {
            id: testModel
            ListElement { name: "A Cat 1"; alphabet: "A" }
            ListElement { name: "A Cat 2"; alphabet: "A" }
            ...
        }

        ListView {
            id: list
            anchors.fill: parent
            ...
        }

        SectionScroller {
            listView: list
        }
    }
    \endcode
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty  ListView SectionScroller::listView

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool SectionScroller::platformInverted
    \since 1.1

    If platformInverted is \c true, the component is visualized with the
    inverted style. For more information, see
    \l {Using Inverted Style with Symbian Components}. By default
    platformInverted is \c false.
