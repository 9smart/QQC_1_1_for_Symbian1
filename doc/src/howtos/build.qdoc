    \title Building the Qt Quick Components

    The Qt Quick components source is available on Gitorious here: \l
    {http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-components}.

    There are Qt Quick components implementations for MeeGo and Symbian devices.
    Each implementation can be built for the target platform or for desktop
    platforms. The desktop build allows you to build and test applications more
    quickly than using the target device. However, you  still very much need to
    test your application on a device since the capabilities of a device
    (memory, cpu, network) are much lower than a desktop machine and will affect
    the usability of your application.
